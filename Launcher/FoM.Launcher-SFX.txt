<br /><br />
<p><strong>Notice</strong>: Game Experience May Change During Online Play</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Face of Mankind, a massively multiplayer online game (&quot;FoM&quot; or the &quot;Game&quot;). FoM is offered by Duplex Systems (<strong>DPS</strong>) and Nexeon Technologies (<strong>Nexeon</strong>). FoM is a massively multiplayer role playing game that allows the participation of thousands of players around the world, interacting in the same game environment. You may play FoM using Duplex Systems' proprietary software (the &quot;Client&quot;) that allows you to log into Nexeon&rsquo;s computer system (the &quot;System&quot;) online and interact within the game environment created by DPS. To play, DPS and Nexeon require that you review and agree to the following terms and conditions. </p>
<p>This End User License Agreement (&quot;EULA&quot;) describes the terms and conditions under which you may (i) install and use the Software; and (ii) subscribe to, access and use Face of Mankind. Nexeon and DPS may amend this EULA from time to time. If you accept this EULA, the then-current version of this EULA shall apply each time you access the System or play Face of Mankind. </p>
<p>By checking the &quot;ACCEPT&quot; box below, and confirming your acceptance by clicking the &quot;START&quot; button (or if you bypass or otherwise disable the &quot;ACCEPT&quot; box and/or the &quot;START&quot; button, and still install, copy, download, access or otherwise use the Software or the Game), you accept the terms and conditions in the EULA. If you do not accept the terms and conditions in the EULA, you must discontinue use of the Software and not access the System or use Face of Mankind.</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>REQUIREMENTS TO PLAY</strong><br />
  To play Face of Mankind you must: (i) establish online a valid account (an &quot;Account&quot;), which can either be a free account or a premium account that requires paying subscription fees on a timely basis; (ii) obtain and maintain your own Internet access (Internet access is required to play Face of Mankind; DPS and/or Nexeon are not responsible for your access to the Internet); and (iii) comply with the EULA. </p>
<p>1.	<strong>YOUR ACCOUNT</strong><br />
You may establish only one (1) account for each copy of the Software licensed. If you wish to establish another Account, you must obtain another license for the Software. (You may be able to do this by purchasing another premium account. You may not establish more than one (1) free account. You also may not establish one free account and a second premium account.)</p>
<p>A. <strong>Establishing a New Account </strong><br />
When it is started, the Software will prompt you to enter your Account data (Username, Password). You can get this data by registering a new Account online at www.fomportal.com. Upon establishing a new Account, you will be entitled to play Face of Mankind after you have verified your account by verifying your email address. Access to your premium features will only be granted after paying the subscription fees. If your premium Account is not terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth below, you will be charged the subscription fees as described during the premium registration process. </p>
<p>Only an individual, natural person who is an adult or, in the discretion of such an adult, his or her minor child, may establish an Account. You are responsible and liable for all activities conducted through your Account, regardless of who conducts those activities. </p>
<p>You may not share your Account with anyone, or allow anyone other than you personally (or your minor child, if you have registered an Account on behalf of your minor child) to access or use your Account. Joint or shared ownership or use of an Account by more than one user is prohibited. </p>
<p>Accounts may not be used for business purposes. Access to the System and playing Face of Mankind is intended for your personal entertainment, enjoyment and recreation, and not for corporate, business, commercial or income-seeking activities. Business entities and anyone who is acting for or on behalf of a business or for business purposes may not establish an Account, access the System or play Face of Mankind. Accessing the System or using the Game for commercial, business or income-seeking purposes is strictly prohibited. </p>
<p>B. <strong>Passwords and Names </strong><br />
You will be asked to select a password during the registration process (&quot;Password&quot;). You may not disclose your Password to anyone or allow anyone to use your Password to access the System or play Face of Mankind. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Password and for any damage, harm, lost or deleted characters, etc. resulting from your disclosure, or allowing the disclosure, of any Password, or from use by any person of your Password. You may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the password of anyone else. You are responsible for remembering your Account information and Password. </p>
<p>You will be assigned a login name and a character name during the registration and character creation process. You may not allow anyone to use your login name or character name to access the System or play Face of Mankind. No player may use the character name of another player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity. You may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the login name or character name of anyone else. </p>
<p>You are encouraged to use a pseudonym, but you may not choose a name that violates anyone's trademarks, publicity rights or other rights. Acceptance of a pseudonym by the System does not mean that your chosen pseudonym does not violate anyone's rights. You are responsible for any liability incurred by yourself, DPS or Nexeon or anyone else due to the pseudonym you choose. DPS and Nexeon retain the right to reject any pseudonym they determine, in their sole discretion, is unlawful, indecent, obscene or otherwise violates standards of good taste. </p>
<p>C. <strong>Children </strong></p>
<p>i. Responsibility for Account <br />
  Minor children may not establish an Account without the consent of a parent or guardian. If the user of Face of Mankind is a minor, a parent or guardian must complete the registration process to establish an Account, in which case the parent or guardian takes full responsibility for all obligations under the EULA and for all activities of the child using the Account. If you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account). </p>
<p>If you establish an Account, you represent that you are an adult eighteen (18) years of age or older and are either accepting the EULA on behalf of yourself or on behalf of your child, in which latter case you agree to the EULA with regard to your child and represent that you are also personally bound by the EULA. </p>
<p>ii. Game Rating <br />
  DPS and Nexeon have established Rules of Conduct (discussed below) for players accessing the System and may, but are not obligated to, monitor and take action regarding inappropriate conduct. Nonetheless, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the System that you may consider inappropriate for children or that may be offensive to some users of any age. You acknowledge that other players may transmit communications or content, or access to content, that you may consider inappropriate or objectionable. DPS and Nexeon do not, as a matter of policy, prescreen the communications or content transmitted by each player and are in no way responsible for the communications and content transmitted by players of the Game. </p>
<p>DPS and Nexeon do not knowingly collect any information beyond that necessary to establish an Account and play the Game. DPS and Nexeon will not disclose such information to any third party except as set forth below. </p>

<p>5.	You may not engage in any conduct that results in an Account containing items, objects, currency, character attributes, rank, or status that are inappropriate for the level or rank of the character contained in the Account, including without limitation arranging, making or accepting transfers of items to a character without adequate consideration, thereby augmenting or aggregating items in an Account and increasing its value for an Account sale.You may not take any action or attempt to take any action that changes the game resources, both on hard disk or in memory. <br />
